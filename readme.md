# Advent Of Code solutions

This is my repository of [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions.

Advent Of Code is series of programming challenges, available each day during December (as an advent calendar, hence the name).

As a professional embedded software programmer, I think that Advent of Code is an amazing opportunity to be confronted to other problems, that may be common to other software developers but not so much in the embedded software world.

It is also the opportunity to try new languages, tools and techniques.

My goal in creating this public repository is to record and share some notes about the way I solve these problems.

Thank you so much to the creator of Advent Of Code!
