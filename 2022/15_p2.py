# Part 1 is straightforward. However, we need to be smart for Part 2
# else we will exhaust our computer's resources (the searching space
# is 4000000Â² which will take 16Tb of memory if we want to allocate a
# buffer of this size, and take forever if we try to iterate over all
# points).
#
# So the trick is to reduce the search space. Because we know there is
# only 1 possible solution It has to be right next to the range
# detected by a sensor. So we will iterate over these points only:
# There are roughly 4*len(sensors)*mean(distances) ~ 100 million of
# these points.
